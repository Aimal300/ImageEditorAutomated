# ImageEditorAutomated

Inside code, edits will apply to the chosen file in correct directory

Edits can be changed depending on preference, In mine i have gone for a slight grayscale and sharpen.

You will need to run on powershell on windows:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

Otherwise, check out Pillow library https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
